# Catherine Beagent Web Development Portfolio (Bootstrap)

## Description

This project's goal was to recreate an [earlier portfolio](https://cgbea.github.io/cbeagent-portfolio/) showcasing my web development experience to prospective employers, using Bootstrap classes in place of my own style.css file wherever possible. The website is a responsive portfolio, including a hero, links to my work (or placeholders for future projects), information about me, contact information and a footer. It will be updated as my skills progress.
